# Secureum ZK Workshop '23

Every directory has its quiz with their respective solutions.

At Day 5, we were presented a protocol that simultaneously supports anonymously signaling (Semaphore from Ethereum Foundation) and anonymous NFT auctions. We were told to find as many vulns as we could in 2 days, which was sort of challenging.

I proudly finished 16 out of 32, found some bugs and most importantly: learned A LOT.

Hope you find this repo useful.

Have a great day ðŸ˜Š
